		<p>
			I  wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
			I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
			I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
			I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
			I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink
			But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
